# Hi, I'm Ryan Novitski üëã

I'm a 2025 graduate of Bowdoin College with hands-on experience in deep learning, distributed systems, operating systems, and creative coding. I‚Äôm passionate about solving real-world problems with code ‚Äî whether it's building fault-tolerant systems or designing interactive audio environments.

## üõ† Skills & Interests
- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, Ruby, Bash
- **Specialties**: Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Computer Vision
- **Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch, NumPy, ucontext, XML-RPC, Git, Max/MSP, Ableton Live
- **Interests**: I'm open to a wide range of software engineering opportunities, but I‚Äôm especially passionate about bridging creative technology and code. I enjoy building tools and interactive systems using Max/MSP and Ableton Live, and I‚Äôm also deeply interested in the evolving role of artificial intelligence ‚Äî particularly in applications like computer vision, generative models, and music tech. Whether it's designing real-time audio systems or experimenting with deep learning models, I‚Äôm drawn to work that blends creativity with technical depth.

## üìö Featured Projects
- **[Anthill: Decentralized P2P System](https://github.com/rnovitski24/Anthill)**  
  A distributed system for anonymizing HTTP traffic via randomized multi-node paths and ring-based architecture.

- **[PyTorch: CNN and MLP Comparison](https://github.com/rnovitski24/Pytorch-CNN-MLP-Comparison-CSCI3485)**  
  Designed and tested generalized CNN and MLP architectures with parameter sweeps across kernel sizes and filter counts.

- **[Thread Library in C++](https://github.com/rnovitski24/thread-library)**  
  A user-level threading library using context switching and manual scheduling logic, built from scratch in C++.

## ü§ù Let's Connect
Feel free to explore my work, star a repo, or reach out with questions or collaboration ideas.  
I'm always open to learning, building, and connecting with others in tech and creative coding.
